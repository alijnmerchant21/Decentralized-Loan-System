# Decentralized-Loan-System

White Paper - https://github.com/alijnmerchant21/Decentralized-Loan-System/blob/master/White%20Paper/White%20Paper.pdf

A decentralized loan system designed and developed specifically for an organization catering to their respective demands. 


Decentralized Loan System is designed to address real world problems faced by ‘Loan Systems’ within a specific institution. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the benefits of Interest Free loans within a society. While – this kind of system is majorly based on a peer to peer system, we also introduce ‘Admin’ or ‘Administrator’ for uninterrupted operations within the institution. There are three major actors within the loan system – 
Elite – They are responsible for donating funds within the institution.
Needy – They request for loan as per need.
Admin – They overlook the operations performed within the institution.

The paper also explains in depth the concept of transparency which is sometimes missing within these institutions. Decentralized Loan System is based on a Blockchain system to address this issue. Blockchain being immutable offers the stake holders the ability to audit all the transactions.

Also, the paper describes in detail – the right to vote which is bestowed upon the stake holders. This empowers them to take decisions as to who shall be granted loan, what amount shall be granted and what shall be the repayment term.

While, the loan is based on a Interest Free system – however collateral must be required at all times. The paper also explains, if the collateral offered is not sufficient how can the needy be still benefited from the Loan System.

In the end, the paper also talks about the future scope and benefits of using this kind of system.
